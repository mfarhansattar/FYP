There are certain limitations that need to be kept in mind while using this app.

1)the data set inserted needs to be in csv (comma seperate variable) format.
2)the targeted column (column that you want to make predictiions of) needs to be in binary format.
3)the targeted columns column name needs to be manually entered to let thealgorithm know what to work on.


The steps for usage are as follows.
1) go to the website.
2) browse and select the csv file you want to work.
3) enter the column name that you wish to target. 
4) click the submit button.
5) wait until the prompt tells you the algorithm has finished running
		NOTE: depending on size of data, time will vary

6) the pipeline will only be returned after the two libraies are finished comparing the accuracies.
7) you will only be able to recieve the pipeline that has the higher accuracy
